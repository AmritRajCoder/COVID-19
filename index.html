    <h1 class="what">What is CoronaVirus?</h1><br>
    <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Seven different types have been found in 
        people, including those responsible for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 epidemics.
<br>
    Early reports suggest the new virus is more contagious than the one causing SARS but less likely to cause severe symptoms. 
    There is much we need to learn about the new coronavirus (COVID-19).<br><br>
        Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of viruses that cause respiratory and intestinal illnesses in humans and animals.
            They usually cause mild colds in people but the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 
            China in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 show they can also cause 
            severe disease.
<br><br>
           Since December 2019, the world has been battling another coronavirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
            is the virus responsible for the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 
           (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, following reports of serious pneumonia.</p><br><br>
        <h3 class="hh3">HOW IT SPREADS</h3><br><p>
            People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
            disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
            the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
            coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
            around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
            these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
        <br><br>People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
            person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
            why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
            person who is sick.

        <h2 class="what2">What is COVID-19?</h2><br>
        <p>
            Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory
             syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first identified amid an 
             outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. <br>It was initially reported to the 
             WHO on December 31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global health emergency. 
             On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1 
             influenza a pandemic in 2009.

    <h1>PREVENTION</h1><br>
        <p class="prev1">You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: 
        </p><br>
        <div class="li1">
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
                Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands. 
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
                are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the
                COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease. 
            </li><br>
            <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.
                Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and
                can make you sick.</li><br>
            <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
                dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
                hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                cold, flu and COVID-19.</li><br>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will
                allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread
                of viruses and other infections. 
                </li><br>
            <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of
                these areas. 
                </li><br>
        </ul>

     <div class="flex-child flex2"><div>
         <h3>Social Distancing</h3><br>
        <p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a 
            safe space between yourself and other people who are not 
            from your household.
<br>
            To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) 
            from other people who are not from your 
            household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
<br>
            Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive 
            actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19, 
            including wearing masks, 
            avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your 
            hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
         <h3>Face Masks</h3>
         <p>
            Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to
            limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-
            nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone
            is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and
            other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks
            are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand
            hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. 
            WHO has developed
            guidance for home careb
            and health care settingsc on infection
            prevention and control (IPC) strategies for use when infection
            with 2019-nCoV is suspected.
            <br>
            Wearing medical masks when not indicated may cause
            unnecessary cost, procurement burden and create a false
            sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential
            measures such as hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using
            a mask 
            incorrectly may hamper its effectiveness to reduce the
            risk of transmission.
